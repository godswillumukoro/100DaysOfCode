# The Modern Computer

## Intro to Computer Hardware

Computers are every where but they ultimately just calculate, process and store data.

## Ports

Are connections points that we can connect devices to that extend the functyionality of our computer.

## CPU

The Central Processing Unit is the brain of our computer, it does all the calculations and data processing.

## RAM

The Random Access Memory is our computer's short-term memory. Used to store datat temporarily. Like typing something into a chat.

## Hard drive

Long-term memory. Holds all of our data, which includes all of our music, pictures and applications.

## Motherboard

The body or circulatory system of the computer that connects all the pieces together. A layer that holds computer components together and lets them communicate with one another.

## Power Supply

Converts electricity from or wall outlet into a format that the computer can use.

# Programs and Hardware

Since the computer can only communicate in binary, it means computers speak in machine language. But we speak speak in human language. This means we need some sort of translation dictionary if we want to communicate with machines.

## Programs

Instructions that tel the computer what to do.

## EDB

External Data Bus is a  row of wires that interconnect the parts of our computer, kind of like the veins in our body.

## MCC

The Memory Controller Chip is a bridge between the CPU and the RAM. Like a nerve in your brain connecting to your memories

## Address Bus

Connects the CPU to the MCC and sends the location of the datat, but not the data itself.

## Clock Speed

The maximum number of clock cycles the CPU can handle in a certain time period. 3.40 gigahertz is 3.4 billion cycles per second.
