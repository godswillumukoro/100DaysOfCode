# The Internet

The internet is just a global network of computers

Each computer/router has an IP address to uniquely identify them just like an actual address for your home.

These IP address are assigned by the ISP.

Computers talk to each other using the TCP/IP protocol.

HTTP runs over TCP. Its responsible for handling web trafic (request/response) between a browser (client) and a server.

DNS is used to map IP addresses to domain names.
