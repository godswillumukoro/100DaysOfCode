# Section 1: HTML

## Meta Tags

Snippets that describes a page's content. They are written in the head tag. They do not appear anywhere in the body of the web page.

## Headings, Paragraphs & Typography

`<h1>Heading 1</h1>`
There are six heading h1 to h6.

It is good practice to have just one h1 per page this will help with SEO as it describes the whole content of a page. For example if its a blog post, the blog title should be contained in the h1 tag.

## Links and Images

`<a href="https://google.com" target="_blank"> External link </a>`

When linking to another website, its good practice to open the link on a new window.
