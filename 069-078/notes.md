- The Client was quite impressed with my work and after several reviews from their network. We managed to seal another deal with them.
- Completed one section of Brad Traversy's CSS course
- Sold all my BNB and paid 20% of my debt. Planning on selling my Macbook soon and switch to a chromebook (Lenovo 11e) whuch sells for NGN 20k
- Was offerred a React job but lacked the necessary skills so I couldn't take it yet.
