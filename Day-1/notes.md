WEEK 0:

Computer Science isn't really about programming per-se. Its about problem solving and its applicable not only to computer science, but to ther fields such as arts, social sciences and beyond.

What ultimately matters in this course is where you end up relative to yourself when you began and not relative to others.

### What really is computer science?

![image showing input - box - output](./1.png)

Computer science is problem solving.

Input : Problem that you want to solve

Output : The solution to that problem

Then in between is the code you will write to let computers solve that problem for you.

To begin solving problems, we have to first agree on how we wish to represent input and output.

### Representation

Computers don't speak the same language as us humans, they are man-made devices and they speak a relatively simpler language.

Humans represent numbers in base 10 ie. 0123456789

Computers speak in binary ie. base 2 (0 and 1)

The simple system computers use in representation is known as bits (binary-digits)Â  

Illustration: A light bulb is either on or off. The state of the light buld can be controlled by using a switch or plugging and unplugging the cable that connects electricity to the light bulb.

The state of the light bulb can be represented using bits. ie.

On : 1

Off : 0

Byte : A pattern of 8 bits. Standard unit of representation.

ASCII: Represents 7 digits, limiting. Not many languages can use it. It only contains 356 maximum characters.

Unicode: Better. All languages, written or electronic (eg. emoji) can be represented
