The computer represents colors with numbers. For example, a common representation system that the computer uses today is what's called the RGB which stands for Red, Green, Blue. The computer can display any color in the rainbow using a combination of some red, green and blue colors. The computer represents each of the colors as numbers. eg. rgb(10,34,61).

An Emoji is also made up of bits, just like any key on the keyboard.

But when it comes to displaying the emoji on the screen, the computer will be using different patters of bit to control the dots (pixel) on the screen

A pixel uses 24 bits or 3 bytes. Thats why pictures we tale are measured in :

Kilobyte: Thousands of bytes

Megabutes: Millions of bytes

gigabyte: Billions of  bytes

Movies are pictures that changes and gets displayed quickly at a rate on a screen just like a flip book. 

File formats eg. JPGS, PNG etc. represents different group of people agreeing to store patterns of zeros and ones in a file so when computers are interpreting them, they know what the patterns of zeros and ones represents. 

Algorithms: Step-by=step instructions for solving problems. eg, humans may follow a cookbook for cooking a recipe. Unlike recipes for humans though, algorithms for computers have to be correct and precise.

INPUT - ALGORITHMS - OUTPUT

Functions: Verb or actions, telling the computer to do something.

Conditions: Or branches are tells the computer, "You can either do this or that or maybe this other thing. But how does the computer know what to do? Boolean expression!

Boolean: A question, whose answer is yes or no, true or false, 0 or 1.

Loop: Gets the computer to reuse parts of code over again so you don't have to write so many lines of algorithm.

Algorithm vs Function:

Algorithm: Step-by-step instruction

Function: The computer's implementation of an algorithm.

Elements of Software Design

1. Fatser
2. Efficient
3. Don't repeat yourself+
4. Abstraction: Taking a complicated idea but agreeing to see it on a more simple level.
